# FunkinVortex
A Universal Chart Creation Tool for Friday Night Funkin'

## Quick Notice
FunkinVortex is currently *very* unfinished, so the supported engines list won't necessarily be representative of the actual current supported engines, but rather the engines I plan to support

## Supported Engines
- FNF Legacy
  - Base Game
  - Psych Engine (pre 1.x)
  - Psych Engine (1.x)
  - Troll Engine (1.x)
- FNF V-Slice
- Codename

## Want another engine to be added?
